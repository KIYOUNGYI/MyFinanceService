## Chat-GPT 한테 물어본 내용  
- In spring boot project, I want to place csv file template, and I want client to download that csv template file to his/her local by calling rest-api. How to achieve this?

- Now, I want client to upload his/her template file to my springboot project, and I want to read this file row by row. How to do this?

- For now, I'm not interested in saving his/her csv file to S3 bucket or to my project. However, If I have to save csv file, then I should first save this file to my project and plan to build my own s3 bucket system.
